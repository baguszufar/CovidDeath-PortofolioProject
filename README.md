•  What is the cumulative number of confirmed deaths?
•  Cumulative confirmed deaths per million people
•  Weekly and biweekly deaths: where are confirmed deaths increasing or falling?

Three points on confirmed death figures to keep in mind
All three points are true for all currently available international data sources on COVID-19 deaths:
•	The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be higher than the number of confirmed deaths – this is due to limited testing and problems in the attribution of the cause of death. The difference between reported confirmed deaths and actual deaths varies by country.
•	How COVID-19 deaths are recorded may differ between countries (e.g., some countries may only count hospital deaths, whilst others also include deaths in homes).
•	The death figures on a given date do not necessarily show the number of new deaths on that day, but the deaths reported on that day. Since reporting can vary significantly from day to day – irrespectively of any actual variation of deaths – it is helpful to view the seven-day rolling average of the daily figures as we do in the chart here.
